# Squid Samples

This sample app demos how to connect with a variety of different integrations, including:

- An API integration (the NBA API)
- Two database integrations (the Built-In Database and a BigQuery database)
- An AI Chatbot integration
- An auth integration (Auth0)

### What it is:

- `backend`- A Squid backend that contains security rules, webhooks and scheduled functions.
- `app` - A React frontend that uses Squid's [React SDK](https://docs.squid.cloud/docs/development-tools/react-sdk/) to integration with the integrations mentioned above.
